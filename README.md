# BDSP
Cheat file for BDSP on Nintendo Switch

Master copy folder contains all posted codes or revisions. 

As of 1.1.3 for Diamond and Pearl alike. 
Both cheat files have grown so big we needed to cut codes.
the working cheat files will be in the folder labeled with the date.

Thank you to everyone.

Instructions:

enter inside the dated folder then drag and drop the atmosphere folder
onto the root of your SD card to overlap and replace codes.

SD:/ <Drop into empty area on the open SD card>

Otherwise pick through the cheat files and place in the codes you wish 
to use.
